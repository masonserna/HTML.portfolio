<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a Registered Dietitian potentially interested in a career change to software engineering. I'm trying this full stack web development course from Udemy by Angela Yu.</p>

<p>It's going well so far, and I'm getting the hang of HTML. There's still soooo much more to learn. I'm going to be learning CSS next.</p>

<p>This "About Me" page is part the final web portfolio project of the HTML sections.</p>
